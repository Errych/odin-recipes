# odin-recipes

Hello Odin!
This project is about building webpage with HTML. In this project I'll build a basic recipe webpage using my html knowledge learned in the previous TOP lessons.By the time this project is completed, I will have demonstrated the ability to build simple projects from scratch and problem-solving skill, proper use of semantic tags, and I'll also build the early version-control habit using Git and Git commits.
