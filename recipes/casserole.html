        <h2>Make-Ahead Green Bean Casserole</h2>
        <p>This make-ahead recipe is the elevation of the green bean casserole we all grew up with. Perfect for holiday dinners!</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>butter-flavored cooking spray</li>
            <li>3 large shallots</li>
            <li>1 ¼ pounds fresh green beans, trimmed and halved crosswise</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
            <li>1 (10 ounce) package button mushrooms, sliced</li>
            <li>⅓ cup all-purpose flour, divided</li>
            <li>1 cup half-and-half</li>
            <li>1 cup chicken broth</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon soy sauce</li>
            <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1 cup vegetable oil for frying, or as needed</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        
        <h3>Step 1</h3>
        <p>Spray a 2 1/2-quart casserole dish with cooking spray. Mince shallots until you have 3 tablespoons; slice remaining shallots into 1/8-inch rounds. Set both aside.</p>

        <h3>Step 2</h3>
        <p>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add beans and cook until tender but still crisp, about 4 minutes. Drain, rinse, and pat dry; set aside.</p>

        <h3>Step 3</h3>
        <p>Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Add mushrooms and cook, stirring frequently, until browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Add minced shallots and cook until softened, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in 3 tablespoons flour, then slowly add half-and-half, broth, and soy sauce. Bring to a boil while stirring.</p>

        <h3>Step 4</h3>
        <p>Reduce heat to a simmer and stir until thickened, about 5 minutes. Stir in green beans and season with salt and pepper. Transfer to the prepared casserole dish, cover, and refrigerate 8 hours to overnight, or until ready to bake.</p>

        <h3>Step 5</h3>
        <p>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</p>

         <h3>Step 6</h3>
        <p>Remove casserole from the refrigerator and bake in the preheated oven until heated through and bubbly, about 30 minutes.</p>

         <h3>Step 7</h3>
        <p>While the casserole is baking, dredge shallot rings in remaining flour until evenly coated.</p>

         <h3>Step 8</h3>
        <p>Heat oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Lower shallots carefully into the hot oil, working in batches if necessary. Fry until golden brown, 1 to 2 minutes, then drain on paper towels.</p>

         <h3>Step 9</h3>
        <p>Remove casserole from the oven and top with fried shallots.</p>

        <h2>Editor's Note</h2>
        <p>We have determined the nutritional value of oil for frying based on a retention value of 10% after cooking. Amount will vary depending on cooking time and temperature, ingredient density, and specific type of oil used.</p>
