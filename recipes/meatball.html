        <h2>How to Make Turkey and Stuffing Meatballs</h2>
        <p>The best thing about this recipe is that it uses any stuffing you prefer. here's a non-recipe recipe to follow. Dinner is served in no time.

</p>

<h3>Ingredients:</h3>
<ul >
    <li>1 pound of ground turkey</li>
    <li>3 cups of prepared stuffing</li>
    <li>1 egg, beaten</li>
</ul>
<h3>Steps:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.</li>
    <li>Add ground turkey, stuffing, and egg to a large mixing bowl. Mix the ingredients together until they are all well incorporated. (If you feel like you need a little more moisture, you can add milk or broth, a little at a time until the mixture is moist enough to form into meatballs.)</li>
    <li>Roll 16 to 20 individual meatballs.</li>
    <li>Place on a baking sheet and bake for 20 minutes or until they are fully cooked. (Turkey should be cooked to 165 degrees F.)</li>
</ul>

<p>The best way we can think of to serve these simple meatballs is to make buttery mashed potatoes and serve the meatballs right on top. Pour hot turkey gravy (jarred is fine) over the whole thing and enjoy the most comforting of comfort foods.</p>
